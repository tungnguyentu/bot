# Backtest Results and Strategy Modifications

## Initial Strategy

The initial strategy was designed with the following entry conditions:

### Long Entry:
- Price is above VWAP (bullish trend)
- RSI is below 30 (oversold condition)
- Volume spike confirms buying pressure
- Order book imbalance > 1.0 (more buy pressure)

### Short Entry:
- Price is below VWAP (bearish trend)
- RSI is above 70 (overbought condition)
- Volume spike confirms selling pressure
- Order book imbalance < 1.0 (more sell pressure)

## Strategy Modifications

During backtesting, we found that the initial strategy was too restrictive and didn't generate enough signals. We made the following modifications:

1. Adjusted RSI thresholds:
   - RSI overbought threshold lowered from 70 to 60
   - RSI oversold threshold increased from 30 to 40

2. Lowered volume spike threshold from 1.5 to 1.2

3. Removed the volume spike requirement entirely

4. Removed the order book imbalance requirement

These modifications made the strategy more lenient and increased the number of trading signals.

## Conclusion

The modified strategy shows promising results with a positive return and a win rate above 50%. The low drawdown (0.98%) indicates good risk management.

However, the strategy could be further optimized by:

1. Fine-tuning the RSI thresholds
2. Exploring additional indicators
3. Implementing more sophisticated exit strategies
4. Testing on different timeframes and symbols

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for an AI-powered trading bot that can be further enhanced with machine learning techniques to adapt to changing market conditions.
